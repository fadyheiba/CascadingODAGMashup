Allows the On Demand App Generation workflow to appear seamless to the user all in one page, cascading any detail dashboards so you still have the summary dashboard handy.

Setup:
- Please follow the instructions in the HTML and JS file to replace the App/Sheet IDs with your own. 
- This version of the mashup uses a filter box object with the most common filtering dimensions at the top of the dashboard. This filter box would have to be created by the user and its object ID added to the JS file.
